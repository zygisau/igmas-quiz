This is a markdown file that outlines various tasks to be completed to make a quiz app.

# Quiz App Development Tasks

A quiz app should allow a person to take a quiz. Quizk questions should be declared in json file. The single question should consist of the following:
- question text
- list of possible answers
- correct answer
- type of question (multiple choice, true/false, etc.)
For now let's focus on multiple choice questions only. Each type of question should be handled differently in the app. It should have different react components for each type of question. Architecture should be flexible enough to add more question types in the future.
